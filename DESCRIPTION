Description: This repository contains the manuscript and code for our
    paper: "Stickleback: a machine learning pipeline for detecting
    behavioral events in bio-logging data." (in prep). Stickleback uses
    time-series classification algorithms to detect behavioral events
    (e.g. feeding, social signals) in bio-logging data (i.e. data
    collected by animal-borne sensors such as accelerometers). Two case
    studies are presented: feeding and breathing by blue whales
    (Balaenoptera musculus).
